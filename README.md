# Customer_Churn
Customer Churn Prediction
A machine learning project to predict customer churn using classification models.

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is when customers stop using a company’s services. Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to churn using historical customer data and machine learning techniques.

🎯 Objectives
Understand patterns and behaviors leading to customer churn.
Build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
Provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset
# Features:
Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, etc.)
Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
Service usage (internet service, streaming services, etc.)
Target: Churn (Yes/No)
🔧 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling: scikit-learn, xgboost
Deployment: Streamlit 
🚀 Steps Followed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key patterns & correlations.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values & outliers
Encoded categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding)
Standardized numerical features (Standard Scaler)
Modeling:
Tested multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
Deployment: Built a simple web app for live predictions.
📈 Results
Best Model: XGBoost
Accuracy: 82%
ROC-AUC: 0.88
Key Insight: Customers with month-to-month contracts and higher service charges are more likely to churn.
